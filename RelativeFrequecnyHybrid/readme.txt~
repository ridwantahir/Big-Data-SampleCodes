- This project computes the relative frequencies of words in a text
- The implementation assumes the input format format example given in the input/input.txt file
- The Relative frequencies in the output are expressed in percentages, for example
	- in both stripes and hybrid approach: 56 {(12,40),(13,60)} means 12 occured 40% of the time with 56, while 13 occured 60% of the time
	- in pairs approach: (12,50) 60    means 50 occured 60 percent of the time with 12
